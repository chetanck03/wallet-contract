# BitFrac (BFC) - Real-World Value Through Tokenized Ownership

BitFrac (BFC) is a pioneering ERC-20 token project that bridges the gap between digital finance and real industrial assets. We offer fractionalized ownership of high-performance crypto mining infrastructure housed within secure, revenue-generating industrial facilities. Our mission is to democratize access to these traditionally high-barrier investments and make crypto mining profits and industrial wealth creation available to everyone.

## What We Do

*   **Fractional Ownership of Industrial Assets:** We tokenize ownership of industrial-grade crypto mining operations, allowing anyone to invest and benefit from the yield these assets generate.
*   **Revenue Sharing via Token Yield:** BFC holders receive returns from actual mining activity—real-world output, not speculation. The more tokens you hold, the larger your share of mining profits.
*   **AI-Powered Security Wallet (BFC Wallet):** Our proprietary wallet is equipped with advanced AI security to prevent fraud, phishing, and wallet-level exploits, giving holders peace of mind and unmatched protection.

## How We Create Real Value

*   **Asset-Backed Tokens:** Unlike purely speculative tokens, BFC is backed by real, operational infrastructure. This grounds the token in tangible value and long-term sustainability.
*   **Passive Income from Mining:** Token holders benefit from consistent returns generated by high-efficiency mining rigs operated by our team in secure industrial environments.
*   **Access & Affordability:** Traditional industrial investments are capital-intensive and exclusive. BitFrac opens this market to the masses by offering fractional participation through low-cost, blockchain-enabled access.
*   **Security as a Core Feature:** With AI-driven protections embedded in the BFC Wallet, users enjoy a level of wallet security that proactively defends against emerging cyber threats.
*   **Growth Potential:** As we expand our mining capacity and wallet technology, the underlying value of the BitFrac ecosystem strengthens—benefiting all token holders over time.

BitFrac is not just another token—it's a gateway to own and earn from real-world crypto infrastructure, with next-generation security and complete transparency.

## Project Core Components

This repository contains the foundational elements of the BitFrac project:

*   **`contract/`**: Solidity smart contracts for the BFC token, presale, staking, and revenue distribution.
    *   See `contract/README.md` for a detailed explanation of the smart contracts.
*   **`bitfrac-dapp/`**: A sample decentralized application (DApp) frontend to interact with the smart contracts.

## Tokenomics & Presale Details

*   **Total BFC Supply:** 1,000,000 BFC
*   **Target Total Raise:** Aiming for a significant raise (previously conceptualized around $55m with a larger token supply, now scaled with 1m tokens) to fund expansion of mining infrastructure. The average price per token is targeted around $0.055 across all stages.
*   **Presale Structure:** 7 stages with increasing token price and decreasing token bonuses for early investors.
*   **Staking:** Staking functionalities are built into the `BitFracToken.sol` contract, with rewards from a dedicated allocation.

### Presale Multi-Currency Acceptance

To participate in the presale, investments can be made using the following cryptocurrencies. Please send funds to the respective addresses:

*   **BTC:** `bc1q5j59e3dsggy9a5lemx202xzymlxzzn4dx6uqh2`
*   **ETH (and USDT on ETH):** `0x5230785a457e673E290eDcEEc1Fc065115762A22`
*   **XRP:** `rTuKnJH5LyVCtvTUTjJ2DvTJcDP1KkmrM`
*   **DOGE:** `D67ZgbZYPeqyUCSHEKD9MwPMB6PB2MorLn`

**Note:** Investments made in cryptocurrencies other than ETH (and ERC20 tokens on Ethereum) are processed via an off-chain verification. After sending your funds, you will need to register your transaction through the `BitFracPresale` smart contract (or a DApp interface connected to it), and an administrator will verify the payment before BFC tokens are allocated.

## Development and Structure

This project is organized into two main parts:

1.  **Smart Contracts (`contract/` directory):**
    *   `BitFracToken.sol`: The core ERC-20 token with staking, snapshot, and presale round definitions.
        *   *Total Supply:* 1,000,000 BFC
        *   *Allocations (Percentages of 1M tokens):*
            *   Presale: 55% (550,000 BFC)
            *   Team: 10% (100,000 BFC)
            *   Mining Rewards (for staking & potentially other incentives): 25% (250,000 BFC)
            *   Marketing: 10% (100,000 BFC)
    *   `BitFracPresale.sol`: Manages the presale, including multi-currency investment registration and verification.
    *   `BitFracRevenueDistribution.sol`: Handles distribution of mining revenues to token holders using a stablecoin and token balance snapshots.

2.  **Decentralized Application Frontend (`bitfrac-dapp/` directory):**
    *   A React-based application for users to interact with the deployed smart contracts. This includes functionalities like connecting a wallet, viewing presale status, registering investments, staking tokens, and claiming revenue.

For detailed instructions on contract compilation, deployment, and DApp setup, please refer to the README files within the respective `contract` and `bitfrac-dapp` directories.
